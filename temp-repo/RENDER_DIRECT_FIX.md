# DIRECT FIX FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

This document outlines the absolute simplest way to fix the ReadableStream error on Render.

## The Problem

Your Discord bot is failing with this error:
```
ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined
```

## The Direct Solution

This approach uses Node.js's built-in module preloading to fix the issue at the source:

1. Use the `Procfile` method to ensure Render uses the right startup command
2. Preload a special script with `-r` flag that fixes compatibility before any modules load
3. Set worker-specific environment variables to prevent port scanning

## Deployment Instructions

Follow these simple steps:

### 1. Set Service Type to "Background Worker"

When creating your Render service, choose "Background Worker" not "Web Service".

### 2. Use Procfile-Based Deployment

Render automatically detects the `Procfile` in your repository, so you don't need custom build or start commands.

Your `Procfile` contains:
```
worker: node -r ./preload.js index.js
```

This tells Render to:
1. Start a worker process (not a web server)
2. Use Node.js with the preload script
3. Run index.js as the main entry point

### 3. Set Required Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Render's dashboard:

**Required for your bot:**
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `APPLICATION_ID` - Your Discord application ID
- `ROBLOX_COOKIE` - Your Roblox .ROBLOSECURITY cookie
- `ROBLOX_GROUP_ID` - Your Roblox group ID
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

**Required for worker configuration:**
- `RENDER_SERVICE_TYPE` - Set to `worker`
- `NO_PORT_SCAN` - Set to `true`

## How It Works

The `preload.js` script runs before anything else and:

1. Creates global implementations of missing web APIs (ReadableStream, fetch, etc.)
2. Intercepts and modifies problematic module loading
3. Sets up error handling to prevent crashes
4. Configures the environment for worker mode

Since this happens before any other code runs, the compatibility issues are solved before they can cause problems.

## If You Still Have Issues

If you still encounter deployment problems:

1. In Render dashboard, select "Clear Build Cache & Deploy"
2. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
3. Verify your Roblox cookie is valid and not expired
4. Look for specific error messages in the Render logs

## For Existing Services

If you already have a service and want to switch to this approach:

1. Remove any custom build and start commands
2. Make sure your repository has the `Procfile` and `preload.js`
3. Select "Clear Build Cache & Deploy"
